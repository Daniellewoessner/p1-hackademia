This is the repository for group 8 project 1 (hackademia)

HACKADEMIA is a tips and tutorial application providing users with knowledge and essential life skills through the use of community posts, topics search and user pages.

A person can sign up to the HACKADEMIA application and become a user. This application is a collection of topics related to everyday life skills where users can share tips, tutorials, know how knowledge from topics ranging from car help to financeial assistance. 

Hackademia uses frontend technology like HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

Hackademia's challenges during it's software development phase was team members living in different time zones, and the learnig curve for Bootstrap framework, but we made sure eveyone was supported and got the develpment completed on time. Future features we hope to implement for Hackadamia includes animated icons, scrolling right/left feaures to view different topics, the option to add video posts, the chance to add more topics to the forum and allow users to folow each other. 

To use Hackademia you need to sign up with a username, email and password. Returning users need to sign in to their accounts and navigate to the threads/forum page. You can find any topic you need related to your search or you can scroll down the page through the different topics. Users will be taken to the Topics page once they choose a hack ie. CAR HACK, COOKING HACK, and can access the help they need from this page. Users will also have user page where they can save the topics they choose and submit their own topics.
